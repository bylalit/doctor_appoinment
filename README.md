I’m excited to share that I’ve successfully completed my Doctor Appointment Booking System project built using Python (Django Framework).

This project is a complete web-based application that allows patients to book, manage, and cancel appointments with doctors easily — with both Frontend UI and Admin Panel developed by me.

⚙ Tech Stack Used:

• Backend: Python, Django Framework

• Database: SQLite

• Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript

• Session Management & Authentication: Implemented using Django session handling

• Email Notification System: Sends booking confirmation via email

• Admin Panel: Created a fully functional admin dashboard to manage doctors, patients, and appointments

💡 Key Features:

• User login & signup system

• Book / cancel appointments

• Doctor profile and time-slot selection

• Secure session management

• Email confirmation for appointments

• Responsive frontend for all devices

• Separate admin dashboard for management

Working on this project helped me improve my skills in:
👉 Django views, models, and templates
👉 Database relationships (Foreign Keys & QuerySets)
👉 Frontend design integration
👉 Handling real-world CRUD operations efficiently

I’m proud of how this turned out and I’m continuously improving my Django and full-stack development skills.

💬 Would love to hear your feedback or suggestions!
